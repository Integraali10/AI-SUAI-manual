Bias refers to the assumptions a model makes to simplify the process of finding answers. The more assumptions it makes, the more biased the model is.

Variance refers to how much the answers given by the model will change if we use different training data. The model has low variance if the answers stay the same regardless of the data. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biasâ€“variance_tradeoff}{uno}
